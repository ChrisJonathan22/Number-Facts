# Number-Facts
This is an app which uses a number api from "http://numbersapi.com/" and each number has its own fact. You type a number and then you receive the fact about the number entered. It's built with HTML, CSS/ Bootstrap and Javascript.

Open the index.html file with your browser and type in a number within the input field to get a fact about that number.
